        <h2>7. Trust Score and Ratings</h2>

            <li>Feedback from other players</li>
            <li>Verified account status</li>

        <p>Attempting to manipulate ratings (fake reviews, coordinated voting) is prohibited and may result in account suspension.</p>

        <h2>8. Premium Features and Payments</h2>
        <p>Some features may require payment. If you purchase premium features:</p>
